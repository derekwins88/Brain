# Brain Notes (working)

This is the living source. Anything intended for public reading is rendered
into `docs/Brain.pdf` by CI.

## Conventions
- **Capsule** = a frozen JSON describing a statement + context (not a proof).
- **Claim** sections must clearly state assumptions, scope, and non-claims.

## TOC
- System overview (see `system.mmd`)
- Closeness heuristics (draft)
- Open questions / TODOs
- References: see `/docs/` for compiled PDFs (working artifacts, not proofs).
