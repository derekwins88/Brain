# Introduction

This is the public, auditable view of the **Brain** project: proof-shaped research,
capsules, and system notes. It’s not a proof of P vs NP (don’t @ me), but it’s a
platform that *behaves like* serious work:

- versioned capsules
- CI-checked builds
- diagrams + specs
- links back to source PDFs (where allowed)
