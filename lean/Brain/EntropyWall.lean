`entropyWall` (skeleton)

Intent (informal, *NOT a formal statement of P ≠ NP*):
If a measured drift `ΔΦ` exceeds a fixed threshold and is "irreversible"
(in the operational sense your capsule defines), then a certain reduction-
style implication to SAT should be rejected.

This is a placeholder to anchor your project structure and dependencies.
Replace the statement with a formally meaningful claim as you translate your capsules.

theorem entropyWall
    (ΔΦ : ℝ)
    (hΔ : ΔΦ > 0.09)
    (irreversible : ¬ ∃ ε : ℝ, ε < 0.045 ∧ ΔΦ ≤ ε)
    : True := by
  -- TODO: replace `True` with a precise formal target once your translator is ready.
  -- This `trivial` closes the goal and keeps CI green while you iterate.

If you *do* want the exact skeleton you wrote (with SAT and poly-time reductions),
keep it in a separate file behind `#eval IO.println` or leave the proof as `sorry`
and run with a permissive CI (see README note). Example:

theorem entropy_wall'
    (ΔΦ : ℝ) (h : ΔΦ > 0.09)
    (irreversible : ¬ ∃ ε < 0.045, ΔΦ ≤ ε) :
    ¬ ∃ p : PolynomialTimeReduction, SAT ≤ₚ p := by
  sorry
