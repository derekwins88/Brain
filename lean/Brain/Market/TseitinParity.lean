  Skeleton: formal statement that the 40-bar graph â†’ Tseitin CNF
  enforces a parity/charge constraint and is size/time polynomial.

  TODO:
  - define MarketGraph (40-bar window) as a combinatorial object
  - define TseitinCNF over that graph
  - prove size bound O(n) variables/clauses with constant-degree
  - state/prepare parity property lemma (soundness of the encoding)

  NOTE: This file is allowed to contain `sorry` during movement phase,
  CI is configured with `--allow-sorry` so we can land structure first.
