# Contributing Guide

We keep this project healthy through three simple rules:

1. **All tests must pass**
   - Run Python tests with `pytest -q`
   - Run .NET tests with `dotnet test`

2. **Docs must be touched**
   - Update `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or inline comments where needed.

3. **Each PR must include a story sentence**
   - One line that connects your contribution to the larger narrative.
   - Example: _“This refactor stabilizes the entropy gate — the glyph no longer drifts without cause.”_

Thanks for helping build the Brain ecosystem with both rigor and story.
