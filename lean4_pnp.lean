  Day-1 Lean4 skeleton for the Entropy Collapse capsule.
  Goal: compile cleanly (green check) while sketching the NP-wall / no-recovery gates.

  You can later thread in your capsule metadata:
    • capsule_id:    PROOF⇌<timestamp or hash>
    • ΔΦ window:     21-point canonical series
    • claim switch:  npWall ∧ ¬sat ∧ noRecovery → Claim = P≠NP

namespace EntropyCapsule

/-- NP-wall gate: ΔΦ must exceed 0.09 somewhere in the window. -/
def NPWall (ΔΦ : ℝ) : Prop := 0.09 < ΔΦ

/-- No-recovery gate: there is no ε < 0.045 such that ΔΦ ≤ ε (i.e., no return below the recovery line). -/
def NoRecovery (ΔΦ : ℝ) : Prop := ∀ ε : ℝ, ε < 0.045 → ¬ (ΔΦ ≤ ε)

  Skeleton theorem: encodes the gates as assumptions and concludes `True`.
  This is intentionally trivial so CI + playground both give a green check now.
  Replace the `True` goal with a stronger proposition when you thread real capsule data.

  Notes for Day-2+:
  * Introduce a `SATShape` predicate tied to the clause CNF (via a bridge or an axiom stub).
  * Parameterize the statement over a 21-length vector (ΔΦ₀…ΔΦ₂₀) and prove a meta-lemma
    that when gates hold and the SAT bridge returns UNSAT, we emit the P≠NP claim capsule.
  * Thread proof capsule hash into a `def CapsuleId : String := "<hash>"` and reference it here.
